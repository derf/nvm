**Legacy Warning**: This project has been archived and will not receive updates.

nvm ("NahVerkehrsMonitor") was a light-weight web app frontend for hafas-rest-api v5.
I developed it as a replacement for vrr-infoscreen and as a means to play around with web applications written in Python.
In the end, having a separate project just for local transit stuff that also relies on a middleman API rather than interfacing directly with HAFAS did not work out for me.
So, nvm never got past the initial proof of concept stage.
